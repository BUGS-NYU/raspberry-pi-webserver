A Raspberry Pi is a computer that has ports to plug into a computer monitor. It is capable of doing exactly what your normal laptop or desktop can do; it's just
a lot cuter. 
This is what you'll need:

1. Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) Model B Quad-Core 1.2 GHz 1 GB RAM
2. On-board WiFi and Bluetooth Connectivity
3. 32 GB Micro SD Card 
4. USB MicroSD Card Reader
5. 2.5A USB Power Supply with Micro USB Cable and Noise Filter.
6. HDMI Cable

1. Formatting Micro SD Card.

Inject the Micro SD Card into the card reader and then to your computer. The first step is to format your SD card. A SD card is a memory card and it contains rows of memory chips
that store documents, images, music etc. Memory card formatting is essentially cleaning theSD card by removing any data that was previously on it. Formatting memory cards is important because
it maintains the card's full speed performance, preserves its storage capacity and reduces the risk of storage errors. Formatting a card is actually different from just deleting and erasing content that is stored. When data is erased from the card,
the actual data still on the card, but will be overwritten with new data. Formatting a memory card loses all of its data irreversibly.
